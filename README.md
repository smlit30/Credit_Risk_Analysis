# Credit Risk Analysis with Supervised Machine Learning

This assignment reviews loan applications in an attempt to evaluate good (safe) vs bad (risky) loans.


# 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable one generates a accuracy score and confustion matrix to get to a classification report of the loan applications.  The
This can be seen in the first half of the "credit_risk_resampling" file.  

# 2: Use SMOTEEN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
The SMOTEEN algorithm is used to generate its own accuracy score, confusion matrix as well as a classification report in the second half of the "credit_risk_resampling" file.  

Both of the accuracy scores are around 63% for the different methods.  


# 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
The EnsambleCalssifier algorithm to predict credit classification is used on the "credit_risk_ensemble" file with a slightly higher accuracy score than the other methoods. 

## Results Summary
While the Ensemble classification seemed to product the highest accuracy score in the models.  The overall decision to use these would need further review by the comapny to see how much it would cost to be wrong vs the benefit of having models like these make the decisions.  If the cost is too high for a false positive, approved loan on a bad/risky application, and if the opportunity cost on a false negative is also a bad results.
